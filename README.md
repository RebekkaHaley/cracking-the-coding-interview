## Welcome
This repo contains code related to my solutions to examples and exercises documented in the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" (6th Edition) by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell.

## Cracking the Coding Interview
Cracking the Coding Interview (or CtCI) contains numerous programming interview questions, "ranging from the basics to the trickiest algorithm problems", as stated by the author.

This repo contains my attempts at solving such exercises, or understanding concepts through practice.

The source code can be viewed at `/ctci`, whereas the corresponding notebooks can be viewed at `/notebooks`.

## Miscellaneous Exercises
This repo also contains my various coding practices I used to challenge my knowledge and skills. Usually these exercises have been taken from various software engineering and mathematics textbooks during my studies.

This can be found at `/misc_exercises`.
